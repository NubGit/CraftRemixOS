  # How do I install it manualy 2
   For windows, Press WIN + R that window icon. You will see 'RUN'. type, '%appdata%/.minecraft/saves' [dont type '' if you're typing].
   Mac users, Im sorry. I don't have a mac. But you can look up how to get to the saves folder in minecraft.
   If you're in saves then, click the world you created before with the advanced computer. look for 'computer' then click 1. What if you 
   have more then 1? then go on minecraft AGAIN, then click the same world, then type 'id', write it down or open notepad again. Click the 
   folder number [example 5] you had written down or it's on your notepad. Now bring back the same text file with the code, create a new 
   textfile, in the folder you're in now then paste the code. CTRL + V for windows and CONTROL + V for Mac. Look for Save as, then save it 
   as 'startup.lua' then click save. You're done.
